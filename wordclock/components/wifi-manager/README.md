# What is esp32-wifi-manager?
*esp32-wifi-manager* is an esp32 program that enables easy management of wifi networks through a web application.

*esp32-wifi-manager* is **lightweight** (6KB of task stack in total) and barely uses any CPU power through a completely event driven architecture. Not a single CPU cycle is wasted doing some polling work.

For real time constrained applications, *esp32-wifi-manager* can live entirely on PRO CPU, leaving the entire APP CPU untouched for your own needs.

*esp32-wifi-manager* will automatically attempt to re-connect to a previously saved network on boot, and it will start its own wifi access point through which you can manage wifi networks.

*esp32-wifi-manager* is an esp-idf project that compiles successfully with the esp-idf 3.0 WiP release. You can simply copy the project and start adding your own code to it.
